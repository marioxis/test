## Application E-commerce with Flutter & Node.js & MongoDB

In this project I have created a REST API with *Node.js* with dependencies like `-npm` `http` `express` `nodemon` `bcryptjs` and `mongoose` as database since the data or id are random. For my application I have used *Flutter* and for pre-visualization Flutterflow.

After you clone this project you can:
### Run the project as server side
`cd server` (run terminal from server file)
`npm install` (install all dependencies) 
`npm run dev` (continuos development)

### Run the project as client side
`flutter pub get`
`open -a simulator`
`flutter run`
